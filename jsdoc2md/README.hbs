## API Reference
The default export of this module is [~keyMap()](#module_short-key-generator..keyMap).
That and probably [~characterRange()](#module_short-key-generator..characterRange)
are the only things you need. The other module members (classes) are exported
just in case you feel like you want to extend them and it is not worth a pull request.
